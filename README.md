# snipsnap
Hey,

So, not much to explain here, it's pretty much takes the link you input and gives you a shorter link that redirects back to the original.

You can also use it as a public api like "https://cam-snipsnap.herokuapp.com/?url=example.com", which then will return a JSON object with "result: younewurl.com".

Prepending it with http:// or https:// is not necessary, as it will automatically insert one if it does not find it.

Just make sure your url has a valid domain extension and no $'s and all will work!

If you'd like to, I made a quick video you can watch at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBD7ic5MsJw
