commit: df3062c
*: implement some kind of regex to make sure url's are legit?
*: figure out exactly how I'm going to use httpCheck
*: find out a more elegant solution for the return when the url is already there. prob something like return an object with a flag to figure out on client side

*: possibly add a www check to httpCheck as well, maybe rename it urlCheck? would have to rename the db urlCheck if I do that
*: maybe add an https upgrade to all http routes? seems like kind of a pog thing for the SECKSurity engineer in me
